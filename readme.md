My entry into the [Antiracism Symbol Design Challenge](http://www.randomhousebooks.com/campaign/antiracism-symbol-design-challenge/)

Channeling the [Black Power fist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raised_fist) and [HRC's logo/equality symbol](https://www.hrc.org/hrc-story/about-our-logo), along with ["Hands up don't shoot"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hands_up,_don%27t_shoot), this design uses simple, clear imagery to convey the antiracist message.
